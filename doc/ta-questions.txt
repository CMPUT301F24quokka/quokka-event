How much functionality should be shared between different account types?
    Should every account have the entrant functionality? - People should be able to be any combination of the different roles (a choice at initial signup is sufficient, could also assign specific users admin privileges directly in firebase)
    Should we be able to login to only one account per device? - use device id to login (no other login process)
